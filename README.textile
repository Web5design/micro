micro is a simple blogging application based on our very own "micro theme":http://micro.seaofclouds.com for mephisto.  as blogware goes, micro is pretty simple - no themes, no plugins, no user accounts, no asset management, no separate admin interface - just pure post-it and share-it goodness.

p{text-align:center;font-size:160%}. micro is blogware that fits in your pocket.

inspired by the more robust "mephisto blogging system":http://mephistoblog.com, and by bloggers everywhere, micro is powered by ruby, rails, jquery, haml, textile and users like you. enjoy.
