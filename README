Micro is a simple blogging application based on our very own micro 
theme for mephisto. as blogware goes, micro is pretty simple – no 
themes, no plugins, no user accounts, no asset management, no 
separate admin interface – just pure post-it and share-it goodness.

MICRO IS BLOGWARE THAT FITS IN YOUR POCKET.

inspired by the more robust mephisto blogging system, and by 
bloggers everywhere, micro is powered by ruby, rails, jquery, haml, 
textile and users like you. enjoy.
